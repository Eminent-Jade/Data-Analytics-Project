This is an analytical report on thermal comfort indexes in Rm.02.412 & Rm.12_431 of Building 11 of UTS based on historical data (May 2021 - Aug 2021) collected by EIF sensors interface.

# to achieve 'comfortable' sensations in indoor environment,

 -- -0.5 <= pmv <=0.5

 -- ppd <= 10%

# handy tool for thermal comfort calculations: https://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/
To simulate settings in my project:
 - Choose 'Relative humidity vs air temperature'
 - Choose 'PMV method'
 - Check 'Use operative temp' box
 - View different 'clothing level' & 'Metabolic rate' values
